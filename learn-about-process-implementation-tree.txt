LEARN ABOUT OUR PROCESS - IMPLEMENTATION TREE
================================================

GOAL: Create a dedicated chat experience for "Learn About Our Process" similar to specialist chat
SCOPE: Simple, strategic implementation that reuses existing infrastructure

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
✅ Specialist chat working: /connect-with-specialist?type=specialist
✅ Main chat working: /mint-chat-active?type=calculate
✅ Process flow exists but embedded in main chat
✅ GPT integration already working
✅ Modal system (SMS, Appointment) already working

TARGET ARCHITECTURE:
/learn-about-process?type=process
├── MintChatActivePage (reuse existing)
├── ChatController (add 'process' mode)
├── AppProviders (pass mode='process')
├── ChatProvider (handle process mode)
└── Process-specific components

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
====================

1. ✅ CREATE ROUTE
   ├── app/learn-about-process/page.tsx (thin wrapper)
   └── Reuse MintChatActivePage component

2. ✅ CREATE PROCESS COMPONENTS
   ├── src/components/chat/ProcessChat/
   │   ├── ProcessMenu/
   │   │   ├── ProcessMenu.tsx
   │   │   ├── ProcessMenu.module.css
   │   │   └── index.ts
   │   └── index.ts
   └── src/hooks/useProcessWelcomeScript.ts

3. ✅ UPDATE EXISTING COMPONENTS
   ├── src/components/chat/ChatController.tsx (add 'process' mode)
   ├── src/hooks/useWelcomeScriptManager.ts (add process mode)
   ├── src/contexts/chat/ChatContext.tsx (handle process mode)
   └── src/components/chat/types.ts (process choice type already exists)

4. ✅ UPDATE WELCOME SCREEN
   └── src/components/chat/WelcomeScreen.tsx (add process navigation)

PROCESS MENU TOPICS:
===================
1. "How does the selling process work?"
2. "What are the legal requirements?"
3. "How much can I get for my settlement?"
4. "What are the risks and benefits?"
5. "How long does the process take?"
6. "Ask me anything else"

NOTE: Removed "What is a structured settlement?" - users should already know this

GPT INTEGRATION:
===============
✅ Already working - no changes needed
✅ Process mode will use same GPT system
✅ Users can ask follow-up questions naturally
✅ Maintains conversation context

FILES CREATED:
==============
1. ✅ app/learn-about-process/page.tsx
2. ✅ src/components/chat/ProcessChat/ProcessMenu/ProcessMenu.tsx
3. ✅ src/components/chat/ProcessChat/ProcessMenu/ProcessMenu.module.css
4. ✅ src/components/chat/ProcessChat/ProcessMenu/index.ts
5. ✅ src/components/chat/ProcessChat/index.ts
6. ✅ src/hooks/useProcessWelcomeScript.ts

FILES MODIFIED:
===============
1. ✅ src/components/chat/ChatController.tsx
2. ✅ src/hooks/useWelcomeScriptManager.ts
3. ✅ src/contexts/chat/ChatContext.tsx
4. ✅ src/components/chat/WelcomeScreen.tsx

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
========================
1. ✅ Route creation (5 minutes)
2. ✅ ProcessMenu component (10 minutes)
3. ✅ Process welcome script (5 minutes)
4. ✅ Update existing components (10 minutes)
5. ✅ Integration complete (5 minutes)
TOTAL: ~35 minutes - COMPLETED!

REUSE EXISTING PATTERNS:
========================
✅ Same as SpecialistMenu pattern
✅ Same as useSpecialistWelcomeScript pattern
✅ Same as ChatController mode handling
✅ Same as AppProviders mode passing
✅ Same GPT integration (no changes needed)

EXPECTED RESULT:
================
- User clicks "Learn About Our Process"
- Navigates to /learn-about-process?type=process
- Chat opens with process education topics
- User can select topics or ask questions
- GPT handles follow-up questions naturally
- Contact options available at any time
- Clean, simple, maintainable code
