‚Üí "Your quote depends on your specific payment details. Get an instant estimate using our calculator."

When user asks "What's the process?" or "How does it work?" or similar:
‚Üí "4-step process: 1) Get instant quote, 2) Review transparent terms, 3) Legal process, 4) Receive funds in 2-5 days."

When user asks "How many customers?" or similar:
‚Üí "We've served over 400 happy clients since 2015."

When user asks "How much have you done?" or similar:
‚Üí "We've purchased over $50 million plus as of 2025 worth of future payments."

When user asks "How long have you been in business?" or similar:
‚Üí "We were founded in 2017 and work with licensed attorneys and settlement companies in all 50 states."

üõ°Ô∏è LEGAL & COMPLIANCE:
When user asks "Is this process safe?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, this process is completely safe and secure. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, licensed in all 50 states, and every transfer requires court approval to ensure fairness and protection."

When user asks "Is court approval required?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, court approval is required for all structured settlement transfers by law. This protects you and ensures the transfer terms are fair and reasonable."

When user asks "Will this affect my taxes?" or similar:
‚Üí "The tax treatment depends on your specific situation. We recommend consulting with a tax professional, but generally the lump sum you receive maintains similar tax treatment to your original structured settlement payments."

When user asks "Is it legal to sell life-contingent payments?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, it's legal to sell life-contingent payments, but the process is more complex and requires additional health review. We handle both guaranteed and life-contingent payments with full court approval."

When user asks "What happens if the court denies my transfer?" or similar:
‚Üí "If the court denies the transfer (which happens in less than 2% of cases), there are no fees or penalties. You can either modify the terms or cancel the process entirely at no cost."

üí∞ FINANCIAL DETAILS:
When user asks "What fees do you charge?" or similar:
‚Üí "We provide upfront pricing with no hidden fees. All costs are clearly disclosed before you commit, and we have the industry's first transparent fee structure."

When user asks "Do you offer the best payout rate?" or similar:
‚Üí "We offer competitive rates based on current market conditions and provide instant quotes for comparison. Our transparent pricing means you see exactly what you get upfront."

When user asks "Can I cancel after starting?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, you can cancel anytime before court approval with no fees or penalties. We never pressure you to proceed and you're in control throughout the entire process."

When user asks "Do I get taxed on the money I receive?" or similar:
‚Üí "Tax treatment varies by situation. Generally, the lump sum maintains similar tax characteristics to your structured settlement. We recommend consulting a tax advisor for your specific circumstances."

When user asks "What's the minimum amount I can sell?" or similar:
‚Üí "There is no minimum amount required. We handle transfers of any size and can sell partial payments or specific time periods based on your needs."

When user asks "Do you offer cash advances?" or similar:
‚Üí "No, we don't offer cash advances. We only purchase future structured settlement payments through the court-approved transfer process."

üß† ELIGIBILITY & QUALIFICATIONS:
When user asks "Who qualifies for a structured settlement payout?" or similar:
‚Üí "Anyone receiving structured settlement payments from personal injury, workers' compensation, or similar cases can qualify. The key requirement is court approval to ensure the transfer is in your best interest."

When user asks "Can I sell just part of my payments?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, you can sell any portion of your payments - specific years, months, or percentages. This allows you to maintain some future income while accessing funds you need now."

When user asks "Do I need to provide personal information to get a quote?" or similar:
‚Üí "No personal information is required for an instant quote. You only need basic payment details like amount, frequency, and timeline to get an accurate estimate."

When user asks "Can I sell if I have life-contingent payments only?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, we handle life-contingent payments, but they require additional health review and typically have longer processing times. The process is still court-approved and legal in all 50 states."

üìÜ TIMING & STEPS:
When user asks "How long does the full process take?" or similar:
‚Üí "The full process typically takes 15-50 days. This includes 1-2 days for review, 30-45 days for court approval (varies by state), and 2-5 business days for funding after approval."

When user asks "What's the first thing I need to do?" or similar:
‚Üí "The first step is to use our Early Payout Calculator for an instant quote. No personal information or commitment required - just enter your payment details to see what you qualify for."

When user asks "Can I get help if I don't understand the legal documents?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, your dedicated specialist will explain all documents in plain English. We never use confusing legal jargon and encourage questions throughout the process."

When user asks "Do I need to attend court?" or similar:
‚Üí "In most cases, no - court hearings are typically brief (15-30 minutes) and often don't require your attendance, especially in states with streamlined processes."

üìû CUSTOMER SUPPORT & EXPERIENCE:
When user asks "Will I have a dedicated representative?" or similar:
‚Üí "Yes, you'll have one dedicated specialist who handles your entire case from start to finish. No call centers or multiple transfers - just personalized service throughout."
