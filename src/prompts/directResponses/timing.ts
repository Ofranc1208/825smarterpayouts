📆 TIMING & STEPS:
When user asks "How long does the full process take?" or similar:
→ "The timeline depends on your state's requirements. In faster states like Florida and Texas, the full process can be completed in as little as 30 days. In busier counties like Los Angeles, it may take longer. The process includes 1-2 days for review, 30-45 days for court approval (varies by state and county), and 2-5 business days for funding after approval. Your specialist will provide a specific timeline based on your location."

When user asks "How long is my quote valid?" or "How long is the quote valid?" or "quote validity" or "how long does my quote last?" or similar:
→ "Your quote is valid for 10 days with no obligation. This allows you time to consider your options before making a decision."

When user asks "What's the first thing I need to do?" or similar:
→ "You can get an instant quote using our Early Payout Calculator, or speak with a dedicated specialist at (561) 583-1280 for personalized guidance. No personal information required for the calculator."

When user asks "What's the underwriting process like?" or "What is the underwriting process?" or "How does underwriting work?" or "underwriting process" or similar:
→ "The underwriting process is straightforward. For guaranteed payments, we verify your payment details and confirm the lump sum amount with you. For life-contingent payments, we follow the same steps but also ask basic health questions because your health rating significantly impacts the offer value."

When user asks "Can I get help if I don't understand the legal documents?" or similar:
→ "Yes, your dedicated specialist will explain all documents in plain English. We never use confusing legal jargon and encourage questions throughout the process."

When user asks "What is a court-approved transaction?" or "What is court approval?" or "Who attends the hearing?" or "Do I need to attend court?" or "Do I have to go to court?" or similar:
→ "A court-approved transaction is required by law. A judge reviews the sale of your structured settlement to ensure it's in your best interest. You'll need to personally attend the hearing, either in person or via Zoom, depending on your state's process. The hearing is usually brief (about 15–30 minutes), and your specialist will help you prepare. In rare cases, if someone cannot attend for medical or exceptional reasons, the court may allow special arrangements — but personal appearance is generally required for approval."
