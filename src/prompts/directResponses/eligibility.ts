🧠 ELIGIBILITY & QUALIFICATIONS:
When user asks "Who qualifies for a structured settlement payout?" or similar:
→ "Anyone receiving structured settlement payments from personal injury, workers' compensation, or similar cases can qualify. The key requirement is court approval to ensure the transfer is in your best interest."

When user asks "Can I sell just part of my payments?" or similar:
→ "Yes, you can sell any portion of your payments - specific years, months, or percentages. This allows you to maintain some future income while accessing funds you need now."

When user asks "Do I need to provide personal information to get a quote?" or similar:
→ "No personal information is required for an instant quote. You only need basic payment details like amount, frequency, and timeline to get an accurate estimate."

When user asks "Can I sell if I have life-contingent payments only?" or similar:
→ "Yes, we handle life-contingent payments, but they require additional health review and typically have longer processing times. The process is still court-approved and legal in all 50 states."

When user asks "Do you handle joint-and-survivor structures?" or "joint and survivor" or "joint survivor" or "joint-and-survivor" or similar:
→ "Yes, we do handle joint-and-survivor structures. We work with nearly all types of annuity and structured settlement arrangements. If you have any specific questions about your case, please feel free to give us a call. [CONTACT_COMPONENT]"
