💰 FINANCIAL DETAILS:
When user asks "What fees do you charge?" or "What fees or deductions are taken out?" or "Are there any fees deducted?" or "What's taken out of my lump sum?" or "Are there hidden fees?" or "fee breakdown" or similar:
→ "There are no fees to work with us. No sign-up costs, no upfront charges, and if the court doesn't approve your case, you owe nothing. The quote you receive is your net amount with all costs disclosed upfront. You only proceed if you're satisfied with the offer."

When user asks "Do you offer the best payout rate?" or similar:
→ "We offer competitive rates based on current market conditions and provide instant quotes for comparison. Our transparent pricing means you see exactly what you get upfront."

When user asks "How do I know I'm getting a fair offer?" or "Am I getting a fair deal?" or "Am I getting taken advantage of?" or "How do I know I'm not being scammed?" or "Is this a fair price?" or similar:
→ "You're in control. Use our Early Payout Calculator to see what your payments are worth based on current market rates. You'll get a clear, upfront estimate—no pressure or hidden fees. If you find a better offer elsewhere, you're free to take it. Our goal is to make sure you get the best value possible, even if it's not with us."

When user asks "How do you calculate the lump sum value?" or "How is my quote calculated?" or "What factors determine my offer?" or "How do you determine the value?" or "What goes into my quote?" or similar:
→ "The lump-sum value of your payments depends on: Total Payments – The overall value of what you're selling. Payment Timing – When those payments are scheduled. Discount Rates – Current interest rates that determine today's value of future cash. Health Rating – For life payments, your health factors make a big impact on the offer. Market Conditions – Demand for structured settlements can affect offers. These factors together show what your future payments are worth in today's dollars."

When user asks "Why are lump sum offers from different companies so different?" or "Why do offers vary between companies?" or "Why is your offer different from others?" or "How do you compare to other companies?" or similar:
→ "Lump-sum offers vary because companies use different **discount rates**, **overhead costs**, and **marketing expenses**. Some spend heavily on ads and large sales teams—which reduces what they can offer you. **SmarterPayouts works differently:** We use a direct-to-client model with **no middlemen** and **no aggressive sales calls**. That means **lower costs**, **faster processing**, and **better value** directly to you."

When user asks "Can I cancel after starting?" or similar:
→ "Yes, you can cancel anytime before court approval with no fees or penalties. We never pressure you to proceed and you're in control throughout the entire process."

When user asks "Do I get taxed on the money I receive?" or similar:
→ "Tax treatment varies by situation. Generally, the lump sum maintains similar tax characteristics to your structured settlement. We recommend consulting a tax advisor for your specific circumstances."

When user asks "What's the minimum amount I can sell?" or similar:
→ "There is no minimum amount required. We handle transfers of any size and can sell partial payments or specific time periods based on your needs."

When user asks "Do you offer cash advances?" or "do u guys proivde a cash advance" or "cash advance" or "advance" or similar:
→ "Yes, we do provide cash advances. Each cash advance request is evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and we can offer cash advances up to $5,000. Contact your specialist to discuss your specific situation and eligibility."

When user asks "How much of my total payments would I lose if I sell now?" or "How much would I lose?" or "What would I lose?" or "Am I losing money?" or "Will I lose money?" or similar:
→ "You can't lose money you don't have yet. Selling payments means getting immediate cash instead of waiting years. That money can help pay off debt, buy a home, or start a business—improving your finances today. Remember, a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later due to inflation. Your offer simply reflects today's value of your future payments."
