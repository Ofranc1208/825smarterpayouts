// REDUNDANT FILE - MARKED FOR DELETION
// This component duplicates metrics already shown in the main dashboard
// All navigation metrics are now integrated into the main MetricsOverview component
// This file is safe to delete after testing confirms the main dashboard works correctly

/*
 * REDUNDANCY ISSUE:
 * This NavigationMetrics component shows the same type of performance metrics
 * that are already displayed in the main dashboard's MetricsOverview section.
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * Navigation-specific metrics have been integrated into the main dashboard.
 * This eliminates duplication and provides a cleaner user experience.
