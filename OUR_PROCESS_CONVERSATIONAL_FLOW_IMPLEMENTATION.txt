OUR PROCESS CONVERSATIONAL FLOW IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=================================================================

GOAL:
When users click the "Our Process" button, instead of navigating away from chat,
provide a conversational explanation of our 4-step process followed by contact options.

CURRENT STATE:

- Navigation currently goes to /main#process (breaks chat flow)
- Rich knowledge base exists with process information
- Contact modals (SMSModal, AppointmentModal) already exist

TARGET USER EXPERIENCE:
1. User clicks "Our Process" button
2. AI responds: "Great! Let me explain our simple 4-step process..."
3. AI explains each step conversationally
4. AI shows: "Ready to get started? Here's how to reach us:"
5. Interactive contact buttons appear (SMS, Phone, Email, Appointment)

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
