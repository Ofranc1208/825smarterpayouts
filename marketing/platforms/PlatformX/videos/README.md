## How It Works:

The video selector analyzes your topic and content for keywords:
- "cash", "money", "lump sum" â†’ Selects cash-finance videos
- "court", "legal", "approval" â†’ Selects court-legal videos  
- "planning", "future", "goals" â†’ Selects planning-future videos
- "family", "security", "protection" â†’ Selects family-security videos
- etc.

If no keywords match, it falls back to default videos.
