2. **Quality**: High resolution, professional appearance

4. **Style**: Clean, modern, business-appropriate
5. **Text**: Minimal text overlays (Facebook algorithm prefers images with <20% text)
6. **Format**: JPG or PNG format

## How It Works:

The image selector analyzes your topic and content for keywords like:
- "cash", "money", "lump sum" → Selects fb-cash-finance images
- "court", "legal", "approval" → Selects fb-court-legal images  
- "planning", "future", "goals" → Selects fb-planning-future images
- "family", "security", "protection" → Selects fb-family-security images
- "home", "house", "mortgage" → Selects fb-family-home images
- etc.

If no keywords match, it falls back to fb-default images.
