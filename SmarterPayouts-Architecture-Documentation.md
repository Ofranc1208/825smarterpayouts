### Architecture Patterns

#### Director Stage Pattern
```typescript
// Advanced component orchestration for complex workflows
const GuaranteedStepper: React.FC = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<StepType>('mode');

  const renderCurrentStep = () => {
    switch (currentStep) {
      case 'mode': return <GuaranteedPaymentOverview onNext={handleNext} />;
      case 'amount': return <GuaranteedPaymentAmountOverview onNext={handleNext} />;
      // ... additional steps
    }
  };

  return <div className={styles.stepperContainer}>{renderCurrentStep()}</div>;
};
```

#### Multi-Context System
```typescript
// Separate contexts for different AI interactions
export interface CalculatorContextType {
  currentStep: CalculatorStep | null;
  formData: CalculatorFormData;
  startCalculator: () => void;
  handleFlowSelect: (flow: 'guaranteed' | 'lcp' | 'compare-offer') => void;
}
```

#### Service Layer Architecture
```typescript
// Business logic separated from UI components
export class CalculationService {
  public static calculateLCP(formData: LCPFormData): LCPCalculationResult
  public static calculateGuaranteed(formData: GuaranteedFormData): GuaranteedCalculationResult
  public static calculateComparison(lcpFormData: LCPFormData, guaranteedFormData: GuaranteedFormData)
}
```
