```

### Architecture Patterns

#### Director Stage Pattern
```typescript
// Example: GuaranteedStepper.tsx
const GuaranteedStepper: React.FC = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState<StepType>('mode');
  
  const renderCurrentStep = () => {
    switch (currentStep) {
      case 'mode':
        return <GuaranteedPaymentOverview onNext={handlePaymentOverviewComplete} />;
      case 'amount':
        return <GuaranteedPaymentAmountOverview onNext={handlePaymentAmountOverviewComplete} />;
      // ... other steps
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className={styles.stepperContainer}>
      {renderCurrentStep()}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Context Management
```typescript
// CalculatorContext.tsx
export const CalculatorProvider: React.FC<CalculatorProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const guaranteedFlow = useGuaranteedFlow();
  const lcpFlow = useLCPFlow();
  
  const currentStep = lcpFlow.currentStep || guaranteedFlow.currentStep;
  const formData: CalculatorFormData = {
    guaranteedData: guaranteedFlow.formData,
    lcpData: lcpFlow.formData
  };
  
  // ... context methods
};
```

#### Service Layer
```typescript
// calculationService.ts
export class CalculationService {
  public static calculateLCP(formData: LCPFormData): LCPCalculationResult {
    // Business logic implementation
  }
  
  public static calculateGuaranteed(formData: GuaranteedFormData): GuaranteedCalculationResult {
    // Business logic implementation
  }
}
```

### Component Development

#### Stage Component Pattern
```typescript
interface StageProps {
  onNext: (data: StepData) => void;
  currentStep?: number;
  totalSteps?: number;
}

const StageComponent: React.FC<StageProps> = ({ onNext }) => {
  // Local state management
  // Form validation
  // Data collection
  // Call onNext with collected data
};
```

#### AI Integration
```typescript
// PromptManager.ts
export class PromptManager {
  private static readonly SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Mint, the AI assistant for SmarterPayouts...`;
  
  public static getSystemMessage(): { role: 'system'; content: string } {
    return {
      role: 'system',
      content: this.SYSTEM_PROMPT
    };
  }
}
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// calculationService.test.ts
describe('CalculationService', () => {
  test('calculateLCP should return valid result', () => {
    const formData: LCPFormData = {
      // Test data
    };
    const result = CalculationService.calculateLCP(formData);
    expect(result.npv).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

#### Component Tests
```typescript
// GuaranteedStepper.test.tsx
describe('GuaranteedStepper', () => {
  test('should render initial step', () => {
    render(<GuaranteedStepper />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Payment Overview')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
