## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Payment Mode Selection**
```
Assistant: "Welcome to your guaranteed payment calculation! I'm here to help you through each step.

Right now, you're selecting how often you receive your payments. Here's what each option means:
• Monthly: 12 payments per year
• Quarterly: 4 payments per year
• Semiannually: 2 payments per year
• Annually: 1 payment per year
• Lump Sum: Single large payments on specific dates

What questions do you have about payment frequencies?"
```

**User asks**: "What's the difference between monthly and lump sum?"

**Smart Response**: Uses contextual knowledge about current step to provide relevant comparison.

### **Step 2: Amount Entry**
```
Assistant: "Great! Now we need to collect your payment details for your Monthly payments.

I'll need your payment amount and the date range when you receive these payments.

What questions do you have about entering your payment information?"
```

**User asks**: "How do I know what amount to enter?"

**Smart Response**: Provides guidance specific to monthly payments and references their actual selection.

### **Step 3: Review**
```
Assistant: "Perfect! Let's review your guaranteed payment information:

**Payment Type:** Monthly
**Payment Amount:** $2,500
**Payment Period:** January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2034
**Annual Increase:** 3%

Everything look correct? I can help you:
- Understand how these details affect your offer
- Explain what happens in the calculation
- Answer questions before you get your final offer"
```

### **Step 4: Offer & Handoff**
```
Assistant: "🎉 Congratulations! Your guaranteed payment offer is ready!

**Your Offer Range:**
- Minimum: $245,000
- Maximum: $267,000

This range reflects current market conditions and your specific payment structure."
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Context Interface**
```typescript
interface GuaranteedAssistantContextType {
  // Core functionality
  isOpen: boolean;
  messages: GuaranteedAssistantMessage[];
  currentStep: string | null;
  formData: GuaranteedFormData;              // 🆕 Form data awareness
  
  // Enhanced messaging
  sendContextualMessage: (text: string) => void;  // 🆕 Context-aware responses
  
  // Helper methods
  getStepGuidance: () => string;             // 🆕 Step-specific guidance
  getSummaryForHandoff: () => string;        // 🆕 Handoff preparation
  showWelcomeMessage: () => void;            // 🆕 Contextual welcome
  handoffToMainChat: () => void;             // 🆕 Seamless handoff
}
```

### **Contextual Response Engine**
```typescript
const generateContextualResponse = (
  userMessage: string,
  currentStep: string,
  formData: GuaranteedFormData
): string => {
  // Smart pattern matching + step awareness + form data integration
  // Returns contextually relevant responses
}
```

### **Smart Handoff System**
```typescript
const handoffToMainChat = () => {
  // 1. Generate comprehensive summary
  const summary = generateHandoffSummary(formData);
  
  // 2. Store in localStorage for main chat
  localStorage.setItem('chat_handoff_data', JSON.stringify({
    summary, formData, completedFlow: 'guaranteed'
  }));
  
  // 3. Navigate to main chat with context
  window.location.href = '/mint-intelligent-chat?handoff=guaranteed&chat=open';
}
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

- **Step 4**: "You can now speak with specialists or continue in main chat..."

**User**: "Why is there a range?"
- **Any Step**: Explains market conditions and calculation methodology
- **Offer Step**: Detailed explanation with user's actual numbers

### **Smart Examples Using User Data**

If user selected "Monthly" payments of "$2,000":
```

12 times per year. The calculation considers the timing and frequency 
of these payments to determine fair market value."
```

## 🔄 **Integration Points**
